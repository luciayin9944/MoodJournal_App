## üõ†Ô∏è Set Up

  ###  Prerequisite 1: Install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin

  1. Install PostgreSQL
  2. Install pgAdmin
  3. Create a database
     - After installation, create a new database for the app (e.g., moodjournal_db).

```bash
   psql -U postgres
   CREATE DATABASE moodjournal_db;
```

 4. Update database configuration
    - In your Flask app config (or .env file), update the database URI:
```bash
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://postgres:<yourpassword>@localhost:5432/tracktrip_db'
```

- Replace <yourpassword> with your actual PostgreSQL password.


 ###  Prerequisite 2: Resgister OpenAI API key

  1. LLog in / Sign up at OpenAI. https://auth.openai.com/log-in
  2. Create an API Key: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys
  3. Update your app configuration:
     - In your Flask app.py (or .env file), set the API key:
```bash
    from openai import OpenAI
    import os
    client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
```

   - Replace OPENAI_API_KEY in your environment variables with your actual API key.
